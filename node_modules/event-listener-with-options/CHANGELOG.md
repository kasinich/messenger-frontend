## 1.1.0 (2018-09-26)

* Added TypeScript type definitions.

## 1.0.4 (2018-06-04)

* Lazily check for capture support. Avoids accessing DOM APIs during import, so
  merely importing won't break in non-browser environments, and possibly aids
  JS engine code caching.

## 1.0.3 (2017-07-07)

* Updated Flow type definitions for Flow v0.49.1.

## 1.0.2 (2016-05-10)

Initial recommended stable release.
